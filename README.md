# Covid-Assist

Covid Assist Website : https://covid-assist-all-you-need.herokuapp.com/

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

During the current pandemic, finding all that we need under a single umbrella is a boon. FInding what you need altogether aids the user in finding what they need. Some services are needed exclusively for the location they reside in. There are numerous existing resources, websites and data scattered around the web providing help throughout India. 


SOLUTION:

A better solution to this problem is creating a web app “Covid-19” providing a one stop destination where the public can look into and get useful information to help others. 
The web app has the following features:

Providing helpline numbers based on location
Covid 19 statistics in different states of India
Redirecting to relevant tweets on Twitter’s live feed for current information on resources  such as beds, oxygen, etc in various cities of India.
Providing websites of all State governments.
Relevant resources regarding facilities such as food, hospitals, vaccinations, plasma, online doctor consultation, etc. are displayed.
Latest news updates on Covid-19.
An online community giving support to people by looking up and verifying resources.
